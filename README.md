Pill Panda
==========

A friendly & reliable companion to help you keep track of things.

**Goals:** 
Build an accessible, lightweight, offline-first, secure way to log & track your medications, mental health, & self-care routines.

**Current Status:**
General architecture working. No build step, pure html/js/css. Components being composed together. Need to add state next, follow outline in index.html for designing screens/components. 


#### Architecture
- UI Styling Framework - [Spectre.css](https://picturepan2.github.io/spectre/index.html)
- Templates - [htm](https://github.com/developit/htm)
- UI Component Library - [Preact](https://preactjs.com/)
- Modals - [Preact Portal](https://github.com/developit/preact-portal/)
- Routing - [Preact Router](https://github.com/preactjs/preact-router)
  - [preact-router @ unpkg](https://unpkg.com/preact-router@2.3.2/)
  - [Preact Router - Async Module](https://github.com/mjanssen/preact-route-async)


#### Research

  - [Official Boilerplate | Github](https://github.com/developit/preact-boilerplate)
  - [Preact w/out Babel | Official Examples | Github](https://github.com/developit/preact-without-babel)
- ES Modules, .mjs, & Compilation
  - [modern js (mjs) breakdown from preact author](https://jasonformat.com/enabling-modern-js-on-npm/)
    - Unsure what take is here. mjs isn't ready, really. Also doesn't give any real benefit outside of 'it doesn't need to compile', is that enough?
